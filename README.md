#Flight-Booker
This app is a flight booker in which users search for and choose a flight which fits their parameters. They then finish booking their spot on the flight by entering relevant passenger information. It uses ActionMailer to send confirmation emails to passengers confirmed for the particular flight. View on [Heroku](https://radiant-fortress-17197.herokuapp.com/)
